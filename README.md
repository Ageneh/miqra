The original source for the provided JSON files stems from [tanach.us](https://tanach.us/).
I have used their provided files (in XML) as the base, then transformed and stripped their contents and produced these JSON files.

Motivation behind this repo is that I was working on a small project in which I needed the Tanach but simplified and in a JSON format.
So I stumbled upon [tanach.us](https://tanach.us/) and used their XML files to produce the given JSON files.
